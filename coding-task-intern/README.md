## Coding task for Intern/ Jr. Software Engineer

The task is to build a part of client section of a system. It should be done in max 48 hours after receiving it.

### Context

This is a simple coding task not a coding challenge. This has only **Create and Read** of the small CRUD part for the 
client section of the application.

### Task

Things to do

1. Create a form to get 
  1. Name
  1. Gender
  1. Phone 
  1. Email 
  1. Address
  1. Nationality
  1. Date of birth
  1. Education background 
  1. Preferred mode of contact (select one from email, phone, none)
1. You can be creative with the fields.
1. Add relevant validation to the form both frontend (js) and backend (php)
1. After form submission, if fields are valid save to a csv file
1. Show all clients pulled in from the CSV as another page

### Things to consider

1. As the task is easy, we will look into the software design part of things, just making it work is not enough.
1. Naming classes, methods and variables properly will be checked.
1. Simple code is better, still think how easy will it be to add things like update and delete client.

### Rules/Requirements

1. This task needs to be completed and submitted back within 48 hours of receiving it.
1. You can use plain OO PHP or any PHP framework/micro framework. **Laravel preferred**.
1. You will need to use PSR-O or PSR-4 autoloading. PSR-4 preferred.
1. Code must be comply with **PSR-2 coding standards**.
1. You must have a readme.md file in the root, **well formatted in markdown** (like the one you are reading now) that explains your solution.
1. Use of any extra open-source library or package is allowed only via composer/packgist. You will need to explain why you used it in the read me file.
1. You can use any front-end library or framework, **bootstrap preferred**. You can even use jquery or other javascript library for validation.
1. You must use git and submit this task as a **private or public git repository on github/bitbucket** another option is a zip/tar file.

### Bonus points

1. If you can add detail view page to the listing page, it will be good.
1. Adding pagination will earn you some more point.
1. Any relevant details in the readme.me file **is a plus**.

### Final Note 

Just completing the task might be at 2-4 hour job. If you just complete the requirements of the task its like getting 60 out of 100. You have been given 2 days so roughly 16 hours (work time) considering that you will invest time in learning things you might not know.

This task can be done by a student, a software engineer with 1 year experience or a software engineer with 5+ years of experice. The main **question is do you aim for 100/100 or just 40/100** that will just pass you in the task, take a wise decision. Don't do things to just make it work, think about making it maintainable too.
